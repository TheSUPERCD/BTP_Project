This project will involve analysing electrical and optical loss limits in solar cells with different architectures (bifacial, PERC, and tandem). 
The aim is to come up with a model with an analytical or a semi-analytical framework, so that we are able to provide guidelines for efficient design of these 
solar cells with different architectures.
